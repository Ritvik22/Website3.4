                All of our content creators and develepors believe 
                that the internet has grown huge, but to the point
                 where it's a little too big. Entertainment isn't 
                 handed to you. Even in such modern 
                 times, you have  to work for it. You have to search for broweser 
                 games, Browse for funnny videos. All of it takes way too much time. 
                 Trying to have some fun on the internet is just a 
                 waste of energy...</p>
